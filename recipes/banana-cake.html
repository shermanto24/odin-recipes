    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This banana cake was made for me by a friend while I was visiting her after she had delivered her 11th child. I told her, "I should have baked for you!"</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cake:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups mashed bananas</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 ⅛ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup butter</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Frosting:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan.</li>
        <li>Make cake: Mix mashed bananas with lemon juice in a small bowl. Mix flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Cream sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Beat in flour mixture alternately with buttermilk. Stir in banana mixture. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove cake from the oven and place it directly into the freezer for 45 minutes. This will make the cake very moist.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make frosting: Cream butter and cream cheese until smooth. Beat in vanilla. Add confectioners sugar and beat on low speed until combined, then on high until frosting is smooth.</li>
        <li>Spread frosting on cooled cake.</li>
    </ol>
